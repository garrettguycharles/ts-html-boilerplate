# ts-html-boilerplate

## Developing
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. run `npm run start`, and look at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to view your work!

## Deploying
1. run `npm run build`. This will build a `dist/` folder which has all of the files ready to be deployed.
Note: `npm run build` is currently missing the styles for some reason, so it's got a bug!
